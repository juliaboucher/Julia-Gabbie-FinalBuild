          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p class="lead">Have you ever wondered how much wealth your home created throughout the years? It is something you wouldn’t think of often - or even at all if you don’t own any form of property. But what even is homeownership wealth? Homeownership can easily create wealth through monthly payments towards your mortgage which decreases your debt, alongside things done to your home like repairs or design aesthetics which increases the value of your home (source). This wealth grows from your homeownership and it eventually pays off. 
</p>

          <p>We wanted to explore this idea of homeownership wealth and what it really means in Hartford, CT by using an affordable housing program as a standing point. The Center for Leadership and Justice is an organization that works in the greater Hartford, CT area that responds to different issues brought up in the community. They have created multiple different nonprofit organizations, created affordable housing units, started a children’s hospital, and so much more. One of their subsidiary organizations is Urban Suburban Affordables (USA) which is a partnership with the Connecticut Department of Housing. USA is able to purchase the land of family homes and allows low-income families to purchase a home, and then enter a lease with the program. Due to this initiative, more than 200 families were able to purchase their homes in the greater Hartford region (source). We worked with this organization’s data to answer the overarching question: How much homeownership wealth has been created by the USA program?
</p>

          <p>So how does homeownership wealth play into the USA program? Houses are being bought and owners are paying and caring for them, making wealth - but how much wealth has this program created? By calculating the allowable resale prices through the USA program and comparing it to the market value or through looking at the mortgage payments and house prices that have been adjusted for inflation will allow us to answer this question. We will explore four homes in the North End of Hartford and how much wealth they have created with the help of the USA program. </p>

          <h2>Findings</h2>

          <p>The median value of single-family USA homes in Hartford was about $135,000. Our four sample USA houses in the North End of Hartford ranged from about $115,000 to $140,000 in Zillow estimated market value. They were located in census tracts 5244, 5240, 5039, and 5040. We used this sample to then estimate how much wealth had been created since each home was last purchased, comparing original sales prices to current market values and USA allowable resale prices.</p>

          <p>Down below shows an image of a map showing the different median values of USA Homes.<a href='https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/R8wjQ/3/'> Sample Median Value of USA Homes </a> similar to the sample below.</p>

          <p> This was my partner's map so I am not able to get the i-frame code. But the last two charts should work.</p>
          <p>This chart compares the Zillow estimated current market value, as well as the USA allowable resale price, to the original purchase price of each of our sample homes. This allows us to make predictions about wealth creation for USA home buyers —- which is a central concern for CLJ, as they aim not only to make housing affordable and accessible for low-income buyers, but to help build wealth and socio-economic mobility for these buyers as well. </p>
          <p>Compared to the original purchase price, the value of all four sample homes increased, especially the longer they were owned, indicating that USA homes are a positive investment for buyers. Additionally, while the USA allowable resale price is less than the estimated market value, the difference tended to range between $20,000 and $50,000. As a result, USA home owners were still able to make a large profit comparable to the current market value, while keeping the homes at a rate below market value that would keep them more affordable to future lower-income buyers who might otherwise be priced out of the current market. Down below shows an image of a chart of the <a href= 'https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/qVPxS/3/' > Current Market Value vs. Allowable Resale Prices</a>, simple to the sample below. </p>

          <h2>EDIT Section 3 Label</h2>

          <p>Create a separate section to describe how you obtained your data, key steps in your process, and cautions for interpreting its meaning. Write for an audience of future Trinity College students who may wish to replicate your steps. Write in HTML format and always include links to data sources, like this example from <a href='https://data.ct.gov'>CT Open Data</a>. Also link to your shared Google Sheets when appropriate.</p>

          <p>Give credit to people, organizations, resources, and tools that helped you to create this data story. Write in HTML format and include links when appropriate. When you paraphrase or quote from a specific reading, cite it using any standard academic citation style (such as MLA or APA inline citations), and include the full reference in a bibliography section at the end of your data story. For help with creating citations, I highly recommend the <a href='https://zbib.org'>Zbib.org</a> tool. Insert any URL, but you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details, such as author and date if the tool does not automatically recognize them, as shown in Image 1 and 2 below.</p>

          <img src="screenshots/sample-zbib1.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 1: After inserting a URL into the ZBib.org tool, you may need to click the Edit button to manually add missing details.</i></p>

          <img src="screenshots/sample-zbib2.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
          <p><i>Image 2: Clicking the Edit button in ZBib allows you to enter or correct missing details, such as the full Website Title.</i></p>

          <p>Below are sample sentences with MLA inline citations that would appear in the body of the data story, followed by the full references that would appear in the bibliography at the bottom:</p>

          <h4>Sample sentences</h4>

          <p>The City of Hartford recently created a housing code that requires the registration of the full names and contact information for all owners of apartment buildings -- including the officers of Limited Liability Corporations (LLCs) -- in order to "close municipal loopholes that allow anonymous slumlords to operate unchecked" (Lurye).</p>

          <p>In most towns, the percentage of high-needs students enrolled in traditional public schools surpasses those enrolled in magnet, charter, and technical schools in the most recent academic year (“Resident Town Export”).</p>

          <p>...later, insert a bibliography at the end of your data story:</p>

          <h4>Works Cited:</h4>

          <p>Lurye, Rebecca. “New Housing Code in Hartford Would Keep Slumlords from Hiding Behind LLCs.” Hartford Courant, May 31, 2019. <a href='https://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-news-hartford-housing-code-20190531-hcke2jo2x5fpdgz75xf4hlv2ki-story.html'>https://www.courant.com/community/hartford/hc-news-hartford-housing-code-20190531-hcke2jo2x5fpdgz75xf4hlv2ki-story.html</a>.</p>

          <p>Optional Hint: To display a clickable web link in the bibliography, look at the HTML code in GitHub for the examples above. See how the URL appears twice: once in the "href" and again in the display text. This is not required for your data story, but it looks good and helps readers to click and view your sources.</p>

          <h2>EDIT Section 4 Label: Advanced Tips</h2>

          <p>All of your data visualizations should be interactive. But if you need to insert a static image, you can upload a JPG or PNG to the GitHub repo, and insert it using the HTML image tag ("img") that points to a source image ("src") stored in your repo, as shown below:</p>

          <img src="sample-image.jpg" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <p>Figure 2: Describe your image in a caption, and always credit the source if someone else created it.</p>

          <h4>Optional Subheaders</h4>

          <p>Use subheader tags (such as "h4") to break up long sections of text without creating a new section.</p>

          <h4>Collaborate with Co-Author</h4>
          <p>Compose and edit your data story in Google Docs, where co-authors can work simultaneously. When you're ready to migrate to GitHub, create ONE data story template in ONE author's GitHub account, because only ONE person can edit at a time. But the GitHub account owner can go to Settings > Collaborators > Add People to invite a co-author by using their GitHub username, as shown below. But be careful not to overwrite each other's edits!</p>

          <img src="screenshots/github-collaborators.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">

          <h4>Change background colors</h4>
          <p> This template uses <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/utilities/background/'>Bootstrap background colors</a>. For example, search this "index.html" file for "bg-primary", which sets the navigation bar (line 28), header (line 56), and footer (around line 245) to blue. Changing it to "bg-secondary" switches those colors to gray. Learn about other color options at the link above.</p>

          <h4>Quicker Edits on your Local Computer</h4>

          <p>Instead of slowly making edits on GitHub and waiting for them to appear online, you can quickly make multiple edits in your local computer and view them instantly in your browser. Here's a list of steps:
            <ol>
              <li>Go to your GitHub repo and select Code > Download Zip and uncompress the folder.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/code-download.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>Install a code editor tool. My favorite free open-source option is the <a href="https://pulsar-edit.dev"> open-source Pulsar text editor</a>, but there are many other options.</li>
              <li>Open the "index.html" file with your code editor and make edits.</li>
              <li>In your browser, go to File > Open to view the "index.html" file that is on your local computer. Since this version is temporarily stored on your local computer, your browser bar will display its location in a local format "file..." rather than the online format "https..."</li>
              <img src="screenshots/index-open-with.png" style="width: 75%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>In your code editor, save changes to your "index.html" file, then refresh your browser to instantly view your changes made on your local computer.</li>
              <img src="screenshots/save-edits.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 30px 0">
              <li>After editing, upload the contents of "index.html" from your local computer to your online GitHub account, then view your edits the public web.
            </ol>
          </p>

          <h4>Two Options for Tables</h4>

          <p>If you need to create a table, first try the Datawrapper Tables tool -- see <a href='https://handsondataviz.org/table.html'>HODV Chapter 8</a> -- and embed the results like this:</p>

          <iframe title="Table 1: Suburbs Offer a Small Percentage of Their Seats to Hartford Open Choice Students " aria-label="Table" id="datawrapper-chart-Qrb7J" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Qrb7J/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="972"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
          </script>

          <p>Table 1: Add your standalone caption here.</p>

          <p>A second option is to use the <a href="https://www.tablesgenerator.com/html_tables">Tables Generator HTML tool</a>. Go to File > Import or manually enter your table data, then Generate the HTML code, and paste it here, similar to this sample: </p>

          <style type="text/css">
          .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;}
          .tg td{border-color:black;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;

          <table class="tg">
          <thead>

            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">123</td>
              <td class="tg-dvpl">456</td>
